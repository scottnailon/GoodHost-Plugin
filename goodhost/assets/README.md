# Assets Folder

Place `goodhost-logo.png` in this folder to use a local logo instead of loading from the remote URL.

Download from: https://goodhost.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/goodhost-australian-web-hosting-2.png

If no local logo is present, the plugin will load the logo from goodhost.com.au automatically.
